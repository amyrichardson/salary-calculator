# Salary Calculator

Web app that allows users to input employee data.

## TODO

- [x] Sourcing in files (index.html, client.js, jQuery, style.css).
- [x] Add a single input field and log to the console.
- [x] Append the input to the DOM
- [x] Calculate monthly average and append that to the DOM
- [x] Add remaining fields
- [x] Create HTML table and append rows
- [x] Add a delete button
- [x] Update the totals
- [x] Styling
- [x] Toggle CSS when average salary gets above certain point
- [x] Add a class or two
- [ ] Redo delete button -- needs to delete the employee from the server/eventually database
- [ ] eventually add database
- [ ] Company class -- get working after database implemented

## NOTES

- Break down projects into extremely small pieces
- Using form tag: form is more accessible, can use enter to submit form
- Global variable: something we want to keep track of over time
