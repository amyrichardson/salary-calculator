# Salary Calculator

Web app that allows users to input employee data.

## TODO

- [x] Sourcing in files (index.html, client.js, jQuery, style.css).
- [ ] Add a single input field and log to the console.
- [ ] Append the input to the DOM
- [ ] Calculate monthly average and append that to the DOM
- [ ] Add remaining fields
- [ ] Create HTML table and append rows
- [ ] Add a delete button
- [ ] Styling

## NOTES

- Break down projects into extremely small pieces
- Using form tag: form is more accessible, can use enter to submit form
- Global variable: something we want to keep track of over time
